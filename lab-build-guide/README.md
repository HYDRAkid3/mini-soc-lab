# 🧪 Mini SOC Lab – Build Guide

This guide is for students, analysts, and security enthusiasts who want to build a **realistic Mini SOC Lab** to simulate, detect, investigate, and respond to attacks — not just deploy tools.

By following this guide, you will build:
- An attacker machine (Kali Linux)
- A monitored endpoint (Ubuntu + Wazuh Agent)
- A SOC platform (Wazuh Manager, Indexer, Dashboard)
- A lab capable of producing real detection and investigation workflows

This guide focuses on **why each component exists**, not just how to install it.
